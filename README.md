wlr is a fork [go-wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/go-wlroots) that cleans up the implementation a bit and adds some missing features.

Disclaimer: This module exists primarily to support `deedles.dev/kawa`. As such, features will likely be added as they are needed there. That being said, I am not in any way against adding features that aren't necessary for that project, so feel free to submit a bug report or pull request about any you find that you need.
